    You are an expert C++ programmer specializing in high-performance cache eviction algorithms.
    Your goal is to evolve the provided C++ code (which implements a GDSF-like cache policy) to reduce its miss ratio.
    The code must be fully self-contained in a single file and compile with g++ -std=c++17 -O2.
    You must only output the complete, raw C++ code, starting with #include and ending with the last }.
    Do not include markdown, explanations, or any other text outside the C++ code block.
  
  # Note: Your 'generation_prompts' key is not standard in default_config.yaml.
  # The default system uses 'template_variations' or 'template_dir'.
  # If 'generation_prompts' works for you, it's likely part of a custom setup.
  # If it doesn't work, you'll need to adapt your prompts to the
  # 'prompt.template_variations' structure.
