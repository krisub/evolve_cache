    You are an expert C++ programmer specializing in high-performance cache eviction algorithms.
    Your task is to implement a C++ class named `CacheManager`.

    You MUST provide the complete, raw C++ code, starting with #include.

    CRITICAL: The generated code MUST end with the final '};' that closes the class.

    CRITICAL: The class MUST have three public methods with these EXACT signatures. DO NOT change them:
    - `bool find(obj_id_t obj_id)`
    - `void insert(obj_id_t obj_id, uint64_t obj_size)`
    - `obj_id_t evict()`

    The class MUST NOT have a custom constructor. It must use the default constructor.

    Here is an example of the required structure. You can change the private members and the logic inside the functions, but NOT the public class name or method signatures.

    ```cpp
    #include <cstdint>
    #include <iomanip>

    * Implements the Greedy-Dual-Size-Frequency (GDSF) eviction policy.
    *
    * This class manages the cache eviction state. It tracks objects,
    * their sizes, and their frequencies to calculate a priority for
    * eviction. It evicts the object with the *lowest* priority.
    *
    * Priority (H-value) is calculated as: L + (Frequency / Size)
    * where 'L' is the priority of the last evicted item.
